# C++ Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my C++ learning repository!  
Here I upload everything I practice — from basic syntax to Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

## 📌 Why this repo?
- To track my C++ progress.
- To keep all my practice codes in one place.
- To help others who are also learning C++.
- To build consistency.

## 📁 Folder Structure
- **01_basics** – syntax, variables, operators  
- **02_control_structures** – if/else, loops, switch  
- **03_functions** – functions, recursion  
- **04_arrays_strings** – 1D/2D arrays, strings  
- **05_pointers_references** – pointers, memory  
- **06_oops** – classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism  
- **07_stl** – vectors, maps, sets, algorithms  
- **08_dsa_problems** – topic-wise DSA coding questions  

## 🛠 Tools I Use
- **VS Code**
- **G++ compiler**
- **Online Judges:** LeetCode, CodeStudio, HackerRank

## ⭐ Goals
- Complete C++ basics  
- Master OOP concepts  
- Solve 200+ DSA problems  
- Build small C++ projects
